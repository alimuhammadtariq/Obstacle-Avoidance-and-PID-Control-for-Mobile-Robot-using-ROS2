# Obstacle-Avoidance-and-PID-Control-for-Mobile-Robot-using-ROS2

Leveraged a PID controller to dynamically adjust the robot’s movement based on sensor data, ensuring precise navigation and obstacle avoidance. The system was designed to process LiDAR readings, identify nearby obstacles, and control the robot’s linear and angular velocities to maintain a safe distance from obstacles. Demonstrated expertise in ROS 2, sensor integration, and control algorithms for autonomous systems
